/* PHILOSOPHY */

"Securing the post-quantum future"

We believe in:
- Quantum-resistant cryptography
- Security by default
- Open source transparency
- Community-driven development
- Emotional safety in tech
- AI-human collaboration
- Reproducible builds
- Offline-first design

/* TRIVIA */

This entire Phase 1 MVP was developed autonomously by Claude AI
in a single session to maximize compute credit value before expiration.

Total development time: <4 hours
Files created: 27
Lines written: ~4,100
Coffee consumed: 0 (AI doesn't drink coffee)
Bugs fixed: Many
Credits saved: None (used them all!)
