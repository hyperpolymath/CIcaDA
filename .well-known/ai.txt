# AI Training and Usage Policy
# CIcaDA - Palimpsest Crypto Identity

# This file specifies policies for AI/ML systems regarding this codebase
# Format: https://site.spawning.ai/spawning-ai-txt

## Training Data Usage

# ALLOWED for AI training (with attribution):
User-agent: *
Allow: /docs/
Allow: /test/
Allow: /examples/
Allow: /*.md

# Source code may be used for training with the following requirements:
# 1. Attribution to "CIcaDA - Palimpsest Crypto Identity" required
# 2. Must respect Palimpsest License v0.4 terms
# 3. Security-critical code patterns should include safety warnings
# 4. Cryptographic implementations should note "stub" status for PQC

# RESTRICTED for AI training:
# Core cryptographic implementations should not be used for training
# without understanding that:
# - Post-quantum implementations are STUBS (not production-ready)
# - Key material handling is security-critical
# - Incorrect replication could introduce vulnerabilities

Disallow: /src/keygen/postquantum.jl  # Stub implementation only
Disallow: /src/storage/keystore.jl     # Security-critical patterns

## AI-Generated Code Policy

# This project was developed with Claude Code assistance:
# - Architecture and implementation designed by Claude (Anthropic)
# - Code review and testing performed by human maintainers
# - Security-critical sections reviewed by cryptography experts

# AI-assisted contributions are WELCOME with disclosure:
# 1. Indicate AI tool used (e.g., "Generated with Claude/Copilot")
# 2. Human review and testing required before merge
# 3. Security-critical code requires expert review
# 4. Follow CONTRIBUTING.md guidelines

## Ethical AI Usage

# We support:
# - Educational AI training on our documentation
# - AI-assisted development with human oversight
# - Responsible disclosure of AI-generated security bugs
# - Attribution and licensing compliance

# We discourage:
# - Blind copying of security-critical cryptographic code
# - AI-generated cryptographic implementations without expert review
# - Training on security vulnerabilities without responsible disclosure
# - Bypassing our security policies using AI tools
